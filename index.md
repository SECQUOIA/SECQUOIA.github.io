This is the **SECQUOIA** (**S**ystems **E**ngineering via **C**lassical and **Qu**antum **O**ptimization for **I**ndustrial **A**pplications) research group at Purdue University.
We work on optimization problems with applications in science and engineering and have experience in the study, design, and implementation of such algorithms using hybrid and novel hardware technologies, including **quantum computing, graphical processing units, and classical computing**. Our research focus on applications related to challenging problems in **chemical, process, and energy systems engineering**.
