Welcome to the **SECQUOIA** (**S**ystems **E**ngineering via **C**lassical and **Qu**antum **O**ptimization for **I**ndustrial **A**pplications) research group at Purdue University.

We study optimization problems arising in science and engineering, with a focus on algorithm design, analysis, and implementation. Our work spans classical, hybrid, and emerging computational paradigms, including **quantum computing**, **GPUs**, and traditional **high-performance computing**.

Our methods are applied to challenging problems in **chemical**, **process**, and **energy systems engineering**, with broader relevance to industrial and scientific applications.
