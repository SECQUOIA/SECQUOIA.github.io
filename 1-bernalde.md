David E. Bernal Neira is an Assistant Professor in the Davidson School of Chemical Engineering at Purdue University. His research focuses on the use of mathematical and computational methods to address scientific and engineering problems, particularly in process systems, energy, and chemical engineering. His core expertise lies in nonlinear discrete optimization, where he develops theory, algorithms, and software. He also conducts research in quantum computing and its intersection with optimization. He has co-authored several peer-reviewed publications, developed software tools, and delivered talks and seminars across academia, government, and industry. He has taught multiple courses, including one at the intersection of optimization, quantum computing, and machine learning, which he co-designed. He actively collaborates with researchers across academic institutions, national labs, government agencies, and industry.
