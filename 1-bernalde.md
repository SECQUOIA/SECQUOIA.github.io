			<h2>David E. Bernal Neira</h2>
		</header>
		<p><span class="image left"><img src="{% link assets/images/profile.png %}" alt="" /></span> David E. Bernal Neira is an Assistant Professor in the Davidson School of Chemical Engineering at Purdue University. He specializes in applying mathematical and computer science tools to address problems relevant to science and engineering, for example, physics and chemical, process, and energy systems engineering. In particular, he works in nonlinear discrete optimization, where, besides applications, he has been working in theory, algorithms, and software. He has been involved in research and teaching related to these topics for over a decade, complemented with research in Quantum Computing. He is currently a visiting research scientist at the NASA <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/content/nasa-quantum-artificial-intelligence-laboratory-quail">Quantum Artificial Intelligence Laboratory</a> and the <a href="https://riacs.usra.edu/">Research Institute of Advanced Computer Science</a> from the Universities Space Research Association (USRA). He has co-authored several papers in indexed journals, a few software packages for optimization and quantum computing, given more than 50 presentations and seminars in the United States of America and internationally, co-taught more than five different classes including one he co-designed (on <a href="https://bernalde.github.io/QuIPML22/">the intersection of optimization, quantum computing, and machine learning</a>), and have had the pleasure of collaborating with over a hundred different researchers in academia, national laboratories, government agencies, and industry.
