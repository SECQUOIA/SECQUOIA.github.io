David E. Bernal Neira is an Assistant Professor at the Davidson School of Chemical Engineering at Purdue University. He specializes in applying mathematical and computer science tools to address problems relevant to science and engineering, for example, physics and chemical, process, and energy systems engineering. In particular, he works in nonlinear discrete optimization, where, besides applications, he has been working in theory, algorithms, and software. He has been involved in research and teaching related to these topics for over a decade, complemented with research in Quantum Computing. He has co-authored several papers in indexed journals, a few software packages for optimization and quantum computing, given several presentations and seminars in the United States of America and internationally, taught different classes including one on <a href="https://bernalde.github.io/QuIPML22/">the intersection of optimization, quantum computing, and machine learning</a> (which he co-designed), and have had the pleasure of collaborating with many different researchers in academia, national laboratories, government agencies, and industry.</p>

## Research Interests

<!-- Please see [the research page](5-research.html) for a detailed overview of the research vision and activities of SECQUOIA. -->
In general, a good summary of our work is that we work in Nonlinear discrete optimization via advanced hardware with application in Chemical Engineering. Common focus areas are listed below:

- Mixed-integer nonlinear programming algorithms, software, and theory
- Quantum computing applications for optimization and chemistry
- Study of non-conventional hardware for computing and optimization
- Distributed (quantum) computing and federated learning
- Process design, synthesis, operations, and control via optimization methods
- Applications of process systems engineering techniques for the pharmaceutical, oil and gas, chemicals, and other industries
- Optimization-driven process engineering for a sustainable future
