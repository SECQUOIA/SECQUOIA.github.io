SECQUOIA's teaching goal is to prepare students to become critical thinkers, independent learners, and effective collaborators who can model, analyze, and improve complex process systems. In an era of abundant data and rapid technological change, the ability to evaluate and apply knowledge is crucial for making sound engineering decisions in industry and society. The group designs structured, engaging courses that emphasize active learning, real-world process applications, and team-based problem solving, and treats teaching and mentoring as opportunities to help students connect theory to practice and grow into future leaders in the chemical and energy industries.

Teaching experience

Group instructors and affiliates bring a wide range of classroom and instructional experience, including teaching assistants and course instructors in mathematics, physics, and chemical engineering, interdisciplinary graduate courses (e.g., Quantum Integer Programming), and large-enrollment undergraduate classes such as Process Dynamics and Control. These experiences include designing and co-teaching novel interdisciplinary courses that combine optimization, machine learning, and decision-making, developing electives that integrate data science into chemical engineering applications, and teaching applied, project-driven modules used in industry-relevant coursework.

Mentoring and student outcomes

Mentoring is integral to the group's pedagogy. SECQUOIA faculty and trainees supervise undergraduate, master’s, and doctoral students, and postdoctoral scholars across engineering, physics, computer science, and business. The group provides structured mentoring and professional development that has supported students earning fellowships, awards, and competitive placements; many student projects have led to conference presentations, internship work, and thesis research.

Teaching philosophy and practices

The group's teaching philosophy emphasizes active engagement, clarity of expectations, and alignment between learning outcomes and assessments. Instruction is organized around four guiding principles:

1. Clear structure and alignment — lectures, assignments, and assessments are designed to map directly to learning outcomes and use low-stakes checks and feedback to monitor progress.
2. Application-driven, project-based learning — coursework ties abstract methods to real process systems, often through industry-framed case studies and semester-long team projects.
3. Flexibility for diverse backgrounds — materials include optional refreshers and targeted exercises for varied preparation levels, plus advanced challenges for stronger students.
4. Teamwork as a core skill — classroom projects reflect real-world collaboration, developing leadership, communication, and integration of diverse technical strengths.

Connection to research and open education

Teaching is tightly coupled with the group's research and open-science commitments. Courses incorporate current research examples, encourage reproducible workflows, and share code and documentation openly to reduce access barriers and enable broader participation.

Continuous improvement

SECQUOIA continually refines its teaching through student feedback, pedagogical training, and collaboration with institutional teaching resources. The group welcomes inquiries about course materials, collaboration on instructional efforts, and ways to support diverse learners.
