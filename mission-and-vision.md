# Mission (what SECQUOIA exists to do)

SECQUOIA builds optimization and decision-making tools—from classical to quantum—that turn complex engineering data into reliable, real-world impact.

- Advance systems engineering decision-making by creating and disseminating rigorous optimization and learning methods implemented as usable software, spanning classical, hybrid, and quantum computing, for high-impact industrial and scientific applications (especially chemical/process/energy systems). 
- In parallel, train a diverse and inclusive cohort of engineers/scientists through mentorship, teaching, and open, reproducible research practices.

# Vision (the future SECQUOIA wants to make true)

Make advanced optimization, potentially quantum-enhanced, practical, trustworthy, and broadly accessible as a default “engineering substrate” for designing and operating complex systems, by unifying theory, scalable algorithms, and open tools across emerging hardware.
