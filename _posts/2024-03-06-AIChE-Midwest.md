We are thrilled to share highlights from our dynamic participation at AIChE2023 in Orlando this 2023. Our team's presence was felt across multiple sessions, showcasing our commitment to innovation and collaboration in chemical engineering.

Albert Lee's first debut on the AIChE was a success. His presentation on the Logic-based Discrete-Steepest Descent Algorithm (LD-SDA) for solving Generalized Disjunctive Programming (GDP) was well received.

We thank all who joined us, participated in our sessions, and contributed to the discussions. Your engagement is what makes events like AIChE2023 genuinely memorable. Let's keep pushing the boundaries of chemical engineering together!
