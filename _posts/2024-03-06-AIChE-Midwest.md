We are thrilled to share highlights from our dynamic participation at AIChE2023 in Orlando this 2023. Our team's presence was felt across multiple sessions, showcasing our commitment to innovation and collaboration in chemical engineering.

Zedong Peng's presentation on MindtPy in the software for PSE session was well-received, sparking engaging discussions among peers.

Andres F. Cabeza, our award-winning researcher, delivered a Tributyl Citrate process design talk in the #LatinXinChemE technical session. His groundbreaking work highlighted the importance of sustainable process design and our dedication to diversity and inclusion.

Pedro Maciel Xavier presented his poster on the QUBO.jl Julia environment. Additionally, his participation as a panelist in the #LatinXChemE ☕ panel was inspiring, fostering meaningful dialogue on crucial topics within our community.

We thank all who joined us, participated in our sessions, and contributed to the discussions. Your engagement is what makes events like AIChE2023 genuinely memorable. Let's keep pushing the boundaries of chemical engineering together!
