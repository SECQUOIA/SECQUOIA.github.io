[Zedong Peng](https://SECQUOIA.github.io/2-members.html) obtained his Ph.D. from Zhejiang University in 2021, co-advised by Prof. Gang Rong and Prof. Hongye Su. During his Ph.D., he visited the Grossmann Research Group at Carnegie Mellon University in 2018. In addition, Zedong is also the main developer of [MindtPy](https://pyomo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/contributed_packages/mindtpy.html). We are delighted to have Zedong join our group, and he will work on algorithms and software for Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Programming. Zedong will pursue an academic or research position after the postdoc.
