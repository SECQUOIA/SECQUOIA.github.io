Zedong Peng obtained his Ph.D. degree from Zhejiang University in 2021, co-advised by Gang Rong and Hongye Su. During his Ph.D, he visited the Grossmann Research Group at Carnegie Mellon University in 2018. In addition, Zedong is also the main developer of [MindtPy](https://pyomo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/contributed_packages/mindtpy.html). We are delighted to have Zedong join our group.
