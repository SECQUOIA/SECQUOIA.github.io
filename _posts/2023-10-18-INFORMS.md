We wrapped up our first INFORMS annual meeting. 
- [Zedong Peng](https://SECQUOIA.github.io/2-members.html) presented the work on open-source discrete nonlinear optimizer [**MindtPy**](https://pyomo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/contributed_packages/mindtpy.html). 
- [David Esteban Bernal Neira](https://secquoia.github.io/1-bernalde.html) chaired the session on **hybrid classical quantum algorithms for optimization** and presented as well about quantum and physics-inspired methods for constrained optimization.

For many more to come!
