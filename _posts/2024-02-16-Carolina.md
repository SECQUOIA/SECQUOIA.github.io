Welcome aboard, Dr Carolina Tristán!

We are excited to introduce our newest addition to the SECQUOIA team, Dr. [Carolina Tristán](https://SECQUOIA.github.io/2-members.html), our third postdoc.

Carolina earned her PhD in Chemical Engineering from the University of Cantabria under the guidance of Prof. Raquel Ibáñez and Dr. Marcos Fallanza from the [Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering](https://www.facebook.com/IngenieriaQuimicayBiomolecular/). While pursuing her PhD, she took part in a research stay at Carnegie Mellon University with the renowned [Prof. Ignacio Grossmann and their Research Group](https://capd.cheme.cmu.edu/research/index.html).

As a way of introduction, Carolina presented her PhD research in the PSE seminar series. Carolina's expertise in generalized disjunctive formulation and life cycle analysis make her a valuable addition to SECQUOIA. We look forward to collaborating with her on the optimization of sustainable superstructures and process systems.
