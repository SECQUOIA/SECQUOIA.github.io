Celebrating a remarkable week at SECQUOIA! We were privileged to host two guests this week: Norman Tubman from NASA and Farshud Sorourifar from The Ohio State University. Their inspiring seminars enlightened our week!

We came together for the Fall 2023 SECQUOIA group dinner to cap off an intense and productive week. It was a wonderful opportunity to unwind, share stories, and build connections beyond our research pursuits. Here's to fostering stronger bonds and many more fruitful collaborations ahead!
