Celebrating a remarkable week at SECQUOIA! We were privileged to host two distinguished minds this week: Norman Tubman from NASA and Farshud Sorourifar from Ohio State University. Their enlightening seminars expanded our horizons and fueled our passion for cutting-edge research.

To cap off an intense and productive week, we came together for the very first SECQUOIA group dinner. It was a wonderful opportunity to unwind, share stories, and build connections beyond our research pursuits. Here's to fostering stronger bonds and many more fruitful collaborations ahead! üéâüçΩÔ∏è‚ú®
