We would like to thank the generous gift of one of our Davidson School of Chemical Engineering alumni, who graciously sponsored our team's attendance at the **Purdue University** vs. **University of Wisconsin-Madison** game earlier! \
We had a great time and were glad to support the football team! \
**Boiler up!** 🌲 ⚛ 🌐
