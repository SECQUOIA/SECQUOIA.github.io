We are pleased to announce that both our visiting scholars [Andres](https://SECQUOIA.github.io/2-members.html) and [Pedro](https://SECQUOIA.github.io/2-members.html) have received awards in the **1st [LatinXinChE Virtual Symposium](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/latinxinche_hispanicheritagemonth-latinxinche-activity-7110006993557323776-3gb9)**.
Pedro and Andres were the only finalists who were not faculty or Ph.D. candidates. Yet, Andres got the highest award, allowing him to talk at AIChE and fund his visit to Orlando. Pedro got a memorable mention and a monetary prize!
