I am back at the American Physics Society (APS) March Meeting and this year I had a lot of fun. Moreover, I was involved in the conference in two ways:
- Presentation: I gave a talk regarding quantum distributed algorithms for the Steiner Tree and the Directed Minimum Spanning Tree with asymptotically better performance than a classical counterpart. This work has been done in collaboration with [Phillip Kerger](https://phillipkerger.github.io/) and [Eleanor Rieffel](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=2UvnS7UAAAAJ&hl=en).
- Session chair: I was the chair of session Q70 on Quantum Network Algorithms and Analysis. This was a 3 hour session with 15 talks from all over discussing issue related to a future where we can have networks of devices able to transmit and process quantum information! Details [here](https://march.aps.org/sessions/Q70).
