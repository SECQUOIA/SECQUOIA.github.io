David is back at the American Physics Society (APS) March Meeting, and this year, there was a lot of fun and things to do. Mainly, he was involved in the conference in two ways:

- Presentation: David talked about quantum distributed algorithms for the Steiner Tree and the Directed Minimum Spanning Tree with asymptotically better performance than a classical counterpart. This work has been done in collaboration with [Phillip Kerger](https://phillipkerger.github.io/) and [Eleanor Rieffel](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=2UvnS7UAAAAJ&hl=en).
- Session chair: David was the chair of session Q70 on Quantum Network Algorithms and Analysis. This was a 3-hour session with 15 talks from all over discussing issues related to a future where we can have networks of devices able to transmit and process quantum information! Details [here](https://march.aps.org/sessions/Q70).
