## MindtPy

The Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Decomposition Toolbox in Pyomo (MindtPy) solver allows users to solve Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Programs (MINLP) using decomposition algorithms. These decomposition algorithms usually rely on the solution of Mixed-Integer Linear Programs (MILP) and Nonlinear Programs (NLP). The following algorithms are currently available in MindtPy:

- Outer-Approximation (OA)
- LP/NLP based Branch-and-Bound (LP/NLP BB)
- Extended Cutting Plane (ECP)
- Global Outer-Approximation (GOA)
- Regularized Outer-Approximation (ROA)
- Feasibility Pump (FP)
