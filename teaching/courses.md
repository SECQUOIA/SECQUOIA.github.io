## Process Dynamics and Control at Purdue University - Fall 2023 (CHE 456)

At Purdue, David taught this class for senior undergraduates in chemical engineering, introducing concepts for analyzing and controlling systems when they change with time. It is the first class that chemical engineers encounter during their formation, where the dynamic behavior of systems is considered, being a core competence for our discipline. Through solving differential equations and identifying different processes as systems, this class provides the students with the tools to understand and implement control strategies, focusing on units encountered by chemical engineers.

## Quantum Integer Programming and Machine Learning at Carnegie Mellon University - Fall 2023, 2022, 2021, 2020 (47-779 / 47-785, 18-819F)

At Carnegie Mellon University, David designed and co-taught this course, focusing on introducing concepts in discrete optimization, machine learning, and quantum computing for practitioners. From a perspective that does not require any background in quantum physics and with a strong focus on practical problems, we introduce concepts of integer programming, artificial intelligence, and quantum methods to address these problems. The course wraps up with a practical project where students implement solution algorithms in actual quantum computers and benchmark them against state-of-the-art classical methods.
