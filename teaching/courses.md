# Chemical Process Modeling (CBE 255)
At UW-Madison I co-instructed this course focusing on the computer programming course material. The course provides an integrative overview of how programming tools like MATLAB and python can be used to solve a wide variety of problems in chemical engineering. By the end of this course, students should be sufficiently familiar with programming to solve challenging numerical problems (e.g., batch reaction kinetics).

# Short Courses on Julia and InfiniteOpt.jl
In this short course, I provide a hands-on introduction to:
- programming in [Julia](https://julialang.org/),
- solving optimization problems via [JuMP.jl](https://jump.dev/), and
- modeling infinite-dimensional optimization problems in [InfiniteOpt.jl](https://infiniteopt.github.io/InfiniteOpt.jl/stable/).

</ul>

The course materials are freely available [here](https://github.com/infiniteopt/InfiniteOptTutorials/tree/main/short_course) on GitHub. By the end of this course, students should be familiar with:
- scripting in Julia,
- solving optimization problems in JuMP.jl and InfiniteOpt.jl,
- and should have the resources they need to learn further.

To date, I have taught this course at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, Carnegie Mellon University, and in Busan, South Korea.
